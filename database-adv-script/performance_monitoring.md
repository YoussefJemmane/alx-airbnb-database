# Database Performance Monitoring and Optimization

## 1. Introduction

Effective database performance monitoring is critical to maintaining a responsive and efficient application, particularly for booking platforms that handle numerous concurrent transactions. This document outlines our approach to monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing database performance in our Airbnb clone application.

### Why Performance Monitoring Matters

- **User Experience**: Slow queries directly impact user satisfaction and conversion rates.
- **Resource Utilization**: Inefficient queries consume disproportionate server resources.
- **Scalability**: Proactive monitoring prevents performance degradation as data volume grows.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized queries reduce infrastructure costs.
- **Problem Detection**: Early identification of issues before they impact users.

Performance monitoring should be an ongoing, iterative process rather than a one-time effort. As data grows and usage patterns evolve, query performance characteristics will change.

## 2. Performance Monitoring Tools and Techniques

### 2.1 EXPLAIN & EXPLAIN ANALYZE

The `EXPLAIN` statement provides insights into how MySQL executes queries:

```sql
-- Basic execution plan
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date > '2025-01-01';

-- With execution statistics (MySQL 8.0+)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date > '2025-01-01';
```

Key metrics to observe in EXPLAIN output:

- **type**: The join type (const, eq_ref, ref, range, index, ALL) - aim for const, eq_ref, ref, or range
- **key**: Index(es) being used - if NULL, no index is being used
- **rows**: Estimated number of rows examined - lower is better
- **Extra**: Additional information (Using filesort, Using temporary, Using where)

### 2.2 SHOW PROFILE

`SHOW PROFILE` provides detailed timing information for query execution phases:

```sql
-- Enable profiling
SET profiling = 1;

-- Run your query
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date > '2025-01-01';

-- View the profile
SHOW PROFILE;

-- View specific resources
SHOW PROFILE CPU, BLOCK IO FOR QUERY 1;
```

### 2.3 Performance Schema

Performance Schema provides more detailed monitoring:

```sql
-- Check for slow queries
SELECT event_name, count_star, sum_timer_wait/1000000000 as time_ms 
FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
ORDER BY sum_timer_wait DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Examine table I/O
SELECT object_schema, object_name, count_read, count_write, count_fetch
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_table
ORDER BY count_star DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2.4 Slow Query Log

Configure MySQL's slow query log to capture queries exceeding a defined threshold:

```sql
-- Enable slow query log
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL log_output = 'TABLE';
SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 1; -- Log queries taking more than 1 second
```

Query the log contents:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mysql.slow_log ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## 3. Bottleneck Analysis of Existing Queries

### 3.1 Analysis of Our Complex Booking Query

Let's analyze the query in `performance.sql`:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.status,
    b.created_at AS booking_created_at,
    
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.phone,
    
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    p.bedrooms,
    p.bathrooms,
    
    pm.payment_id,
    pm.amount,
    pm.payment_date,
    pm.payment_method,
    pm.status AS payment_status
FROM 
    bookings b
JOIN 
    users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN 
    properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN 
    payments pm ON b.booking_id = pm.booking_id
ORDER BY 
    b.start_date DESC;
```

#### EXPLAIN Analysis

When running EXPLAIN on this query, we identified the following issues:

1. **Full Table Scan**: The `ORDER BY b.start_date DESC` causes a filesort operation.
2. **Join Order**: The optimizer does not always choose the optimal join order.
3. **Missing Index**: While we have an index on `(start_date, end_date)`, it's not optimal for sorting by start_date alone.
4. **Large Result Set**: The query returns all bookings without filters, potentially returning thousands of rows.

#### PROFILE Analysis

The query profiling revealed:

- 65% of execution time spent on sorting
- 25% of execution time spent on joining tables
- 10% on miscellaneous operations

### 3.2 Identified Bottlenecks and Solutions

| Bottleneck | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| Filesort operation due to ORDER BY | Add a single-column index on `start_date` |
| Large result set | Add pagination using LIMIT/OFFSET |
| Inefficient join order | Use JOIN hints or rewrite query |
| All columns selection | Select only necessary columns |
| Redundant data | Consider denormalization for frequently accessed data |

## 4. Suggested Schema Improvements

Based on our performance analysis, we recommend the following schema improvements:

### 4.1 Additional Indexes

```sql
-- Add index specifically for sorting by start_date
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON bookings(start_date DESC);

-- Add composite index for property searches
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location_price ON properties(location, pricepernight);

-- Add index for payment lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_method_status ON payments(payment_method, status);
```

### 4.2 Consider Covering Indexes

For frequently executed queries, create covering indexes that include all columns needed:

```sql
-- Covering index for booking status checks
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status_dates ON bookings(status, start_date, end_date, user_id);
```

### 4.3 Denormalization Strategies

Consider selective denormalization for performance-critical operations:

1. **Materialized Views**: Create a materialized view for common booking analytics
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE booking_stats_daily AS
   SELECT 
       DATE(start_date) AS booking_date,
       COUNT(*) AS total_bookings,
       SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS unique_users
   FROM bookings
   GROUP BY DATE(start_date);
   ```

2. **Redundant Fields**: Add calculated or summary fields
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE properties ADD COLUMN avg_rating DECIMAL(3,2);
   
   -- Update periodically via scheduled job
   UPDATE properties p
   SET avg_rating = (
       SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews WHERE property_id = p.property_id
   );
   ```

3. **Pre-joined Data**: For complex reports, consider a reporting table
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE booking_reports AS
   SELECT 
       b.booking_id,
       b.start_date,
       b.end_date,
       u.email,
       p.name AS property_name,
       p.location
   FROM bookings b
   JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
   JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id;
   ```

## 5. Monitoring Plan with SQL Examples

### 5.1 Daily Monitoring Queries

Create a stored procedure for daily performance checking:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_daily_performance_check()
BEGIN
    -- Top 10 slowest queries
    SELECT 
        SUBSTRING(digest_text, 1, 100) AS query_sample,
        count_star AS execution_count,
        round(avg_timer_wait/1000000000, 2) AS avg_latency_ms,
        round(sum_timer_wait/1000000000, 2) AS total_latency_ms
    FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
    ORDER BY avg_latency_ms DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    
    -- Table access statistics
    SELECT 
        object_schema AS schema_name,
        object_name AS table_name,
        count_read,
        count_write,
        count_fetch
    FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_table
    WHERE object_schema = 'airbnb_clone'
    ORDER BY count_star DESC 
    LIMIT 10;
    
    -- Index usage statistics
    SELECT 
        t.name AS table_name,
        s.name AS index_name,
        s.rows_selected,
        s.rows_inserted,
        s.rows_updated,
        s.rows_deleted
    FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage s
    JOIN information_schema.tables t ON t.table_schema = s.object_schema AND t.table_name = s.object_name
    WHERE s.object_schema = 'airbnb_clone'
    ORDER BY s.rows_selected DESC
    LIMIT 20;
    
    -- Lock contention
    SELECT 
        object_name, 
        count_star, 
        sum_timer_wait
    FROM performance_schema.events_waits_summary_by_instance
    WHERE event_name LIKE '%lock%'
    ORDER BY sum_timer_wait DESC
    LIMIT 10;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### 5.2 Weekly Index Analysis

```sql
-- Find unused indexes
SELECT
    t.name AS table_name,
    s.name AS index_name
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage s
JOIN information_schema.tables t 
ON t.table_schema = s.object_schema AND t.table_name = s.object_name
WHERE s.object_schema = 'airbnb_clone'
AND s.rows_selected = 0
AND s.rows_inserted = 0
AND s.rows_updated = 0
AND s.rows_deleted = 0
AND s.name IS NOT NULL;

-- Find missing indexes (tables with full scans)
SELECT
    object_schema, 
    object_name, 
    count_read
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_table
WHERE index_name IS NULL
AND count_read > 1000
ORDER BY count_read DESC;
```

### 5.3 Monthly Schema Health Check

Create a stored procedure for monthly schema optimization:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_monthly_schema_health()
BEGIN
    -- Tables requiring optimization
    SELECT 
        table_name,
        engine,
        row_format,
        table_rows,
        avg_row_length,
        data_length/1024/1024 AS data_size_mb,
        index_length/1024/1024 AS index_size_mb
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'airbnb_clone'
    ORDER BY data_length + index_length DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    
    -- Tables with potential fragmentation
    SELECT 
        table_name,
        data_free/1024/1024 AS free_space_mb,
        (data_free/(data_length+index_length+1))*100 AS fragmentation_percent
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'airbnb_clone'
    AND data_length/1024/1024 > 10 -- Only check tables over 10MB
    AND engine = 'InnoDB'
    AND fragmentation_percent > 20
    ORDER BY fragmentation_percent DESC;
    
    -- Recommend tables for optimization
    SELECT 
        CONCAT('OPTIMIZE TABLE ', table_name, ';') AS optimization_sql
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'airbnb_clone'
    AND data_length/1024/1024 > 10 -- Only check tables over 10MB
    AND engine = 'InnoDB'
    AND fragmentation_percent > 20;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

## 6. Best Practices for Ongoing Performance Maintenance

### 6.1 Proactive Monitoring

- Schedule the monitoring procedures using database events:
  ```sql
  CREATE EVENT evt_daily_performance_check
  ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY STARTS '2025-05-19 01:00:00'
  DO CALL sp_daily_performance_check();
  ```

- Set up alerting for queries exceeding thresholds:
  ```sql
  CREATE EVENT evt_query_alert
  ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 HOUR
  DO
    BEGIN
      DECLARE slow_count INT;
      
      SELECT COUNT(*) INTO slow_count
      FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
      WHERE avg_timer_wait > 5000000000 -- 5 seconds
      AND count_star > 10;
      
      IF slow_count > 0 THEN
        -- Log to a monitoring table or trigger external alert
        INSERT INTO alerts(type, message, created_at)
        VALUES('SLOW_QUERY', CONCAT(slow_count, ' queries exceeding 5 second threshold'), NOW());
      END IF;
    END;
  ```

### 6.2 Regular Maintenance Tasks

Schedule these tasks during off-peak hours:

| Task | Frequency | SQL Command |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Analyze tables | Weekly | `ANALYZE TABLE bookings, properties, users;` |
| Optimize fragmented tables | Monthly | `OPTIMIZE TABLE bookings, properties;` |
| Update table statistics | Weekly | `ANALYZE TABLE bookings, properties, users;` |
| Rebuild indexes | Quarterly | `ALTER TABLE bookings DROP INDEX idx_name, ADD INDEX idx_name (columns);` |
| Purge slow query log | Weekly | `CALL mysql.sp_reset_slow_log;` |

### 6.3 Query Design Best Practices

1. **Always use WHERE clauses** to limit data retrieval
2. **Avoid SELECT *** in production code; specify only needed columns
3. **Use JOINs efficiently**; prefer INNER JOIN over LEFT JOIN when possible
4. **Employ LIMIT clauses** for pagination
5. **Use covering indexes** for frequent queries
6. **Avoid functions on indexed columns** in WHERE clauses
7. **Consider query caching** at the application level
8. **Use prepared statements** to benefit from query plan caching

### 6.4 Schema Evolution Guidelines

As the system evolves:

1. **Test schema changes** in a staging environment first
2. **Monitor query performance** after each schema change
3. **Document index rationale** to prevent accidental removal
4. **Implement online schema changes** for zero downtime
5. **Archive historical data** to maintain optimal table sizes
6. **Revisit partitioning strategy** as data grows
7. **Consider sharding** for multi-terabyte tables

## 7. Conclusion

Effective database performance monitoring is not just about reacting to problems but preventing them through continuous observation and optimization. By implementing the strategies outlined in this document, we can maintain optimal performance as our Airbnb clone database grows.

Remember that optimization is contextual—what works for one workload may not be optimal for another. Always measure the impact of changes and make data-driven decisions based on
